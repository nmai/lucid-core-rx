collaborative data management

### Usage
`npm test` will run all tests and watch for changes

The API will be documented here when it's ready. There is no example app yet.

### Description
The objective is to make it easier to create a collaborative app- we will focus on text-based documents for now. Flexibility and approachability is important to me- this library should remain relatively unbiased and have a simple API.

Redux is currently being used to manage state. Not sure how to handle persistent/semi-persistent data, or even whether this library should handle that aspect at all. Will look at couchdb/pouchdb.
